### What I learned
This is a full stack application with authorization. This application helped me understand all the function of a full CRUD application and thought me how to use authorization with bcrypt and passport libraries. 

### Continued development
Add more forms of authorization such as OAuth so users can use Google to log in. 
## Available Scripts

### How to run this app. 

In this repository, it contains a .env.example file. Create a .env file. Create a 'DATABASE_URL' variable equal to your MongoDB key and a 'SESSION_SECRET' variable equal to anything you want.
## `npm install`
Run this to install all dependencies required for the application.
## `npm run dev`
Run this to start application in dev mode with nodemon.
