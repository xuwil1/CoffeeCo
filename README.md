## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Node.js
- Ejs
- Mongoose


### What I learned
This is a full stack application with authorization. This application helped me understand all the function of a full CRUD application and thought me how to use authorization with bcrypt and passport libraries. 

### Continued development
Add more forms of authorization such as OAuth so users can use Google to log in.
